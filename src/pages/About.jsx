        There is an inevitable urgency in re-defining our infrastructure of
        communication. Our models of connection and forms of culture
        distribution are deeply permeated by flawed industrial methods of
        creation based on control and extraction, generating a society of
        commodified attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Setting creation as a closed-control process has conceived a culture of
        ubiquitous uniformity; value can solely be tracked by the quantity of
        connections rather than quality of connections. Amongst several
        outcomes, this has created a shallow perception of value in culture
        creators, which implies that culture is built by repetitive content
        rather than by unique meanings.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a time where we are facing the consequences of systematic extraction
        and control over our environments, we will not be able to reverse these
        issues until we fundamentally start to understand creation as a open and
        variable activity that is subject to change, as a system adaptable to
        the embedded chaos in nature.
      </p>
     <p> - </p>
      <p>
        We will not be able to reverse these issues until we create new
        infrastructure of communication where creation is conceived as a
        cooperative act and an open system where, parallel to nature, it can be
        subject to change and apatations.
      </p>

        Today, the production of media is universal. The development of new
        infrastructure for music interaction on the web on top of the
        massification of personal computing, presents a unique opportunity for
        public access to the core sensorial experiences and creative processes
        which define our cultural essence. By granting the public power and
        control over the creative process, we can build a new conception of
        creation as an open system, where cooperation and adaptation take center
        stage rather than fixation and repetition.

        It is in this context where the Participative Audio Lab (PAL) is
        created, in the midst of a culture of closed creative control. PAL is an
        initiative aimed at harvesting a culture of open creation through the
        development of tools for participative music distribution.{" "}
